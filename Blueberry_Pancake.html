  <h1 style="font-family:Arial; font-size:25pt;"> Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</h1>
  <p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15pt; color:#C2130A; text-align:left;"> Make these and you’ll never use a mix again. It takes less than 5 minutes to make the batter. The key is not to over-mix so no electric mixer, please! They are just as good (& healthier) made with whole wheat pastry flour. - Jenny Jones </p>
